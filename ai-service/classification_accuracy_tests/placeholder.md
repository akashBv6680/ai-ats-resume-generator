# Classification Accuracy Tests (Placeholder)

Later, add dataset-driven tests here:

- Load labeled profession examples from `ai-service/src/data/training_data`.
- Call `classify_profession`.
- Measure accuracy and assert it stays above a target threshold.

This folder is defined by the SRS for:
- Classification accuracy validation
- Regression testing of ML behavior
